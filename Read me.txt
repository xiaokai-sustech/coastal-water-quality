Program descriptions
The package WQI includes the main program WQI, the Entropy program and the AHP program. The operation steps are as follow:

1. Unzip the compressed format file.
2. Modify the corresponding input files of AHP (.txt files) and Entropy (.csv files). Then run the programs without additional changes and the results will be shown in corresponding output files.
3. Copy the weight results (output-AHP.txt & output-Engropy.txt) to the “input-weight-WQI.txt”. Note that the results of AHP and Entropy referred to Wsi and Woi, respectively. The values or concentrations of the “input-lab-WQI.csv” should be changed according to the results obtained in labs.
4. Run the main program (WQI.py) to get the water quality index scores, which is stored in “output-WQI.txt”. Code modifications are not required in the main program.
